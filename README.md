# Cost-sensitive Adversarial Learning
Combination of cost-sensitive learning and adversarial learning

### News
Ready to do some fundamental experiments on basic settings!
Doing experiments to see how one specific attack from one kind to another is influenced.

### Settings
- Normal settings: normal adversarial training
- Specific settings: only generate adversarial examples between given classes
- Test: check accuracy of natural, adversarial, and specific attack results

### Expeiments
- Do experiments between two specific classes, e.g. frog-truck.
- Do experiments between two types of classes, e.g. animal-vehicle.
